You're falling behind, what's happening out there?
This isn't a vacation, pick up the pace!
Are you even trying? Let's go!
This is Survivor, not a day at the beach. Move it!
You're letting this slip away. Wake up!
Is that all you've got? I expected more!
You're not going to win with that effort!
This is disappointing. Show some fight!
Come on, you're better than this!
You're on the verge of blowing it. Step it up!
You're not here to make friends, you're here to compete!
This isn't a leisure cruise. Get moving!
Do you even want to be here? Prove it!
You're letting the win slip right through your fingers!
This performance is underwhelming. Time to turn it up!
Survivor's about resilience, where's yours?
You're in danger of being forgotten. Make an impact!
No pain, no gain. Start gaining!
Others are outshining you, time to shine brighter!
You're not just battling them, you're battling yourself. Win both fights!
